# IoT-Based Fire Detection and Controlling System 🔥🚨

Smart IoT project using ESP8266 for early fire detection, real-time alerts, and automated suppression.  
Developed as a Final Year Project at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM).

---

## 📖 Introduction
Fire incidents in residential areas cause severe damage, and traditional systems lack speed, range, and real-time response.  
This project presents an **IoT-based fire alarm system** that detects fire using sensors, alerts users in real time, and activates fire suppression mechanisms automatically.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
1. Traditional systems rely on human intervention and cannot provide instant alerts.  
2. Lack of real-time monitoring and location sharing in conventional fire alarms.  
3. Absence of automatic fire suppression (sprinklers, alarms) in most existing systems.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design an IoT fire detection system for **real-time monitoring, detection, and alerts**.  
- Use **GSM module** to send **location details via SMS**.  
- Integrate **automatic suppression** with buzzer & sprinkler activation.  

---

## 🛠️ Product Description
The system integrates multiple technologies for effective fire safety:  
- **ESP8266 NodeMCU** microcontroller.  
- Sensors: **Flame, Smoke, Temperature**.  
- **Relay module** to trigger water sprinkler.  
- **Buzzer** for local alarm.  
- **Blynk app** for real-time IoT alerts.  
- **GSM module** for SMS location sharing.  

---

## ✨ Features
- **Multi-sensor detection** (flame, smoke, temperature).  
- **Real-time alerts** via Blynk app.  
- **Automatic suppression**: water sprinklers & buzzer.  
- **Location sharing via SMS** (even without internet).  
- Scalable for residential & commercial use.  

---

## 🚀 Methodology
- Input from flame, gas, and temperature sensors.  
- ESP8266 processes signals and sends commands.  
- Relay triggers buzzer and sprinkler system.  
- Alerts sent to Blynk + SMS notification.  
- Evaluated with performance graphs:  
  - Time taken to send notifications.  
  - Time taken to activate water pump.  

---

## 📊 Results & Analysis
- Fire hazards detected accurately in early stages.  
- Real-time IoT notifications delivered quickly.  
- Sprinkler system activates within seconds.  
- Location SMS ensures emergency response even without Wi-Fi.  

---

## 🌍 Project Potential
- **Scalable**: Suitable for homes, offices, warehouses, and large buildings.  
- **Emergency services**: Local fire departments can receive instant alerts.  
- **Resilient**: Works with GSM even if Wi-Fi fails.  
- **Future enhancements**: Rechargeable battery or solar integration.  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The IoT Fire Alarm System successfully provides **real-time monitoring, early hazard detection, and automated suppression**.  
It enhances safety, reduces property damage, and demonstrates potential as a scalable smart fire prevention solution.
